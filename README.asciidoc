= Background

This is the hydrology gauge stations downloaded for an area near where I grew up in  NY. I used to play and fish and these rivers so I thought it would be nice to look at this data.

== Problems I have seen

Some rows have estimated values - but also some are provisional and some are accepted. Estimated shows up as P:e or A:e

There are variables numbers of items measured, so we can't always assume the same data is in the same column for each data set.

The variables have different ID numbers so I am not sure if they represent the same thing

There is EST (Eastern Standard Time) and EDT (Eastern Daylight savings time)

There are gaps in the measured data, though it is always seem to be in the same




== Solutions for Now

I think I am going to split them each into a file and try to make sure at least the names of the variables are the same.

The file name will be the same as the location

I am going to drop USGS
